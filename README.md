üèÜ Real-Time Leaderboard Task
This project is a full-stack application featuring a dynamic, real-time leaderboard. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, using MongoDB for data persistence. The frontend is a responsive single-page application built with React.

‚ú® Core Features
User Management: Select from a list of users or add new users directly from the UI.

Claim Random Points: Award a random number of points (1-10) to any selected user with a single click.

Persistent Storage: All user data, total points, and claim history are stored securely in a MongoDB database.

Claim History: Every point claim is logged in a separate collection for auditing and historical tracking.

Dynamic Real-Time Ranking: The leaderboard updates instantly after every point claim, showing the latest ranks, names, and total points without needing a page refresh.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Frontend: React.js

Database: MongoDB with Mongoose

Real-time Communication: (Assumed) WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) or efficient polling.
